# Examples

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your base URL and API token.

```shell
BASE_URL=https://SUBDOMAIN.okta.com
API_TOKEN=
USER_ID=Okta user ID you want to test with
```

The easiest way to get started is to run

```shell
python user_create.py
```

And take that new user's ID and put it in your `.env` file.
