# mdwallick/okta-sdk-python

This SDK allows managing an Okta instance via Python. It is a fork of
[okta/okta-sdk-python](https://github.com/okta/okta-sdk-python) and is
maintained by me for my own projects and anyone else who might want to use it.

**Support Disclaimer:** This library is not an official Okta product and does not qualify for any Okta support. Anyone who chooses to use this library must ensure that their implementation meets any applicable legal obligations including any Okta terms and conditions.

## Requirements

* Python >=3.7

## Installing

Install with **pip**

```shell
pip install okta-sdk-python
```

## Usage

See the [examples directory](https://github.com/mdwallick/okta-sdk-python/tree/master/examples)
for usage samples.

## Documentation

Full [class documentation](https://todo.url) is also available.

## Okta Configuration

This SDK requires an Okta tenant, get a free developer account at
[developer.okta.com](https://developer.okta.com).

You also need to create an [administrator-scoped API token](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/create-an-api-token/overview/).
